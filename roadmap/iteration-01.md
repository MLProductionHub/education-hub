# First Iteration

Duration: 2 weeks ~ 1 month.

## Objectives:

1. Creating a general use python library, for a problem of your choice.

2. Practicing Python best practices in a production grade environment.

You can discuss about the problems in issue boards, and join to a problem that you like, you can be in no teams or multiple teams at the same time. Just be sure you are not too busy to contribute meaningfully.

----------------------------------

### Soft Skill Goals:

1. Since these projects are not usually ML specific, they require little experimentation. You should be able to learn how you can estimate how long will it take for you to do a specific task in the scope of this project.

2. You should communicate well in a team. Do daily meetings, prioritize your tasks and be transparent. You should all feel a sense of shared ownership for the team.

3. You should get comfortable searching through Google, [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com), [Reddit](reddit.com) and GitHub issues, or when you do not find any relevant infomation about your problems, asking them in the aforementioned websites or technical forums.

### Technical Goals:

1. You should use typehints and `mypy` to check static typing.

2. You should be able to package your program in a python environment. Your library/program should be installable in your python environment.

3. You should use git fork flow since the projects will be open source, and have a develop branch as your primary branch, while tagging your releases in a master/main branch. For more information read [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

P.S: For the love of god rebase your feature branches and only merge in the main branches. xD

Some ideas:

1. A picture to [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) web service using python.

2. An argument validator library. One of the hassles in writing safe python code is argument checks in the beginning of a function/method. Some libraries like `Flask` have their own validators.

3. An execution time profiler library. There are a set of good python libraries that profile the amount of time each line of code/each function has taken and log them either through `stderr` or a logfile.

4. An audio pitch randomizer web service.

5. A python proofread web service.

6. A python DSP web service that can resample the input data, and filter it.

7. An API wrapper library for the [arXiv](arxiv.org) open api

8. A Python platformer game!

9. A Telegram game bot for something like Mafia, or Secret Hitler.

10. A cryptocurrency price checker cli.

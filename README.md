## First Iteration

Objectives:

1. Creating a general use python library, for a problem of your choice.

2. Practicing Python best practices in a production grade environment.


You can discuss about the problems in issue boards, and join to a problem that you like, you can be in no teams or multiple teams at the same time. Just be sure you are not too busy to contribute meaningfully.

## Introduction

This repository is a collective effort to create, and maintain a beginner friendly yet thorough step by step guide for ML engineer interns and junior engineers to become familiar with different concepts in production ML environment.

### Prerequisites
1. Familiarity with Python. If you do not know how to code in python, this course is too advanced for you. We have a set of minimal tutorials and introductions but they are very brief and exist only to refresh the memory of the students.

2. Familiarity with Machine Learning basics. If you want to become an ML intern, you probably know a bit about how basic algorithms work, what is the focus in ML and why it is attractive.

3. Knowing a bit of a deep learning framework like Keras/TF or PyTorch will help you a ton.
## Structure

A set of step by step procedures and objectives is available at `roadmap` folder. Each file in that folder will include a new set of objectives, some project ideas and a timeline to deliver.
